# pi-lcd-usbinstall-nodejs

## This node.js application is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi, with a 16x2 screen and two buttons (on 23 and 17) attached to the GPIO pins.

# Usage

## When main.js is run, the screen will show the first of a selection of ISOs. You use the button connected to 23 to switch between the ISOs and 17 to select the ISO.

## Plug in a USB drive, select an ISO, and it will install it onto the drive.

# Installation

## In the same directory as this repo, put in Win10.iso, pop-os_21.10.iso, and manjaro-gnome-21.2.iso. You could also put in your own ISOs and edit creation.sh to use those.
